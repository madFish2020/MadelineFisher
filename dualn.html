                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>For this project I used the Design Thinking Process. The first step in this process is to empathize
                    and to empathize with users I needed to understand them. To do this I created an interview plan and 
                    started talking to people who were travelers so I could understand what their process for planning a 
                    trip looked like as well as what problems they faced when planning their trips. 
                </p>
            <div class = "user-interviews">
                <h3> User Interviews</h3>
                <p>For the interview process I had decided to focus on people who travel at least once a year.
                   I wanted to talk to people who typically planned their own trips as well because it was important 
                   for me to understand what this process looks like for frequent travelers. These people also were working 
                   individuals which provided different insights on when they had time to plan trips. I conducted 5 interviews 
                   in total which were held over facetime or zoom due to not only the pandemic but in some cases distance. 
                </p>
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <div class = 'affinity'>
                    <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
                    <p>The first method I used was an Affinity Diagram. I wanted to find commonalities and patterns in what users 
                        were telling me, so I wrote each interviewees answers to the questions I asked on sticky notes and then tried 
                        to group similar subjects together. This allowed me to piece together what common answers were for things like 
                        what they liked about products they used, what they did not like, and what things they look for when picking a 
                        new place to travel to. </p>

                    <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
                    <p>After that I developed an empathy map. I wanted to get to know my potential users even more, so I needed to understand
                       their thought process. The empathy map allowed me to look deeper into who the user was and what things they thought about
                        when planning for travel. This ranged from their goals and needs and pain points to what they were feeling, thinking, and
                        doing. </p>

                    <h3>User Persona</h3>
                    <p>Lastly, I developed a user persona. I did this to understand who my user was and what problems they were facing in their
                        current planning methods. Ashley is an employee looking to take time off to travel. She wants to be able to find an easy
                        way to plan her trips, but the planning process tends to be difficult. Some of her pain points are filter systems not working,
                        and the research process taking too long. Some of her goals are finding places with enough things to do, staying on budget, 
                        and finding the right hotel or Airbnb.</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>For the next step in the Design Thinking Process I had to ideate. This means of course think of ways to solve user pain points.
                To brainstorm I looked at competitors to see what areas of their websites worked and what ways I could make my app stand out from theirs.
                I also put ideas I had into a prioritization-matrix to find the ideas that were the easiest to implement with the highest results. I had limited
                time to work on it so I had to focus on the ideas I was sure I could get done in time. After that I did user flows and sketches to think 
                of how the app would work from a users point of view. The sketches focused more on the design aspects however they were made with the user flows in mind.

                <img src="images/competitor.png" alt="competitor analysis">
                <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p>To pick which Competitors I looked at I looked at the products people said they used in the interview process
                    and went from there. I had never had to plan my own trips in the past, so I was unaware of what competitor
                    products offered and what they looked like. To get a better understanding of what I wanted to include in 
                    Dual Nature I looked at products like TripAdvisor and Expedia to see not only what they were doing well but
                    what they were doing poorly. I wanted to look at all aspects to see what I could use in my own design that
                    would work well but also start thinking of ways to make Dual Nature stand out from the competitors.</p>

                <h3>Prioritization Matrix</h3>
                <p>I then started thinking of a lot of features and needed to figure out which ones to include. After writing all 
                    the features down on sticky notes I began organizing them into a Prioritization Matrix. I did this to determine
                    which ideas would have the highest impact and would be easy to implement. Focusing on these ideas allowed me
                    to think of what could be implemented in the time I had to work on the project. Using high impact and low 
                    complexity ideas only allowed me to limit scope.</p>

                <p>After that I made a user flow to highlight how users would go about achieving various tasks
                   on the app. The top image shows the onboarding process while the bottom image shows in app
                   features such as looking up destinations or stays. I did the onboarding userflow first considering it 
                   is so important to user retention. I wanted to make sure that the users understood what the app had to offer
                   in a way that was not overly complex. I then layed out how the user might use the app so that I could begin
                   to look at what the process of using the app would look like as a user. It was important to making sure the app
                   flowed nicely from the users point of view. </p>

                <p>The sketches focused on the onboarding process in the beginning. I wanted to make sure
                   that people first downloading the app would have an easy time being onboarded. The sketches above
                   are ideas I had on how to layout the sign in and sign up pages. It did not even occur to me at this point
                   how much time I was spending on the starting point of the app. I was hoping to make the sign up and sign in process
                   so easy that I forgot to explain the key features of the app.(the onboarding was changed after this was brought up in 
                   testing). </p>

                   came up with very simple tasks for the users. At this point I had only really focused on onboarding
                   so users simply had to sign up and sign in to the app.</p>

                   it could be added or clarified in the later iterations of the prototype.</p>

                   process so they could  have a better understanding of what the app's purpose was.
                   Almost every single person was confused about what the app was for so it was something
                   I needed to make clear going forward.</p>

                    fidelity prototype that were not already in the app. Some items were just simple fixes while
                    others were much more complex. I wanted to focus on the easy fixes because I had limited time to 
                    fix the app and wanted to implement changes that I could do well. It would not have been beneficial
                    to add something at this point that would have caused more problems than solutions.

                    <h3>Leassons Learned</h3>
                    <p>Focusing your design on the user needs is key, iterating your product is interesting 
                     because your final product is nothing like the initial idea. This was fun for me because 
                     the process was truly user-centerd. I had such little experience with travel apps that it
                     made it even easier to focus on the users. They're feedback and pain points truly drove the 
                     process. I was designing to do the best I could to help users travel planning lives become easier.

                    <h3>Do Better</h3>
                    <p>I could have focused my idea more around the actual app sooner. I spent so much 
                    time worrying about onboarding in the beginning, so I had to play catch up when
                    developing the app functionality and the layout. This put me behind and forced me to 
                    play catch up later in the process which became very time consuming and hard to get
                    through (even if it was worth it in the end).

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>Defining what your user needs is key, you have to compartmentalize what you think
                    someone wants to find out what they really need, user interviews help drive the process
                    of conceptualizing an app for your ideal users, iterating  is so important so you can
                    consistently improve what you are making even if they are small things.
