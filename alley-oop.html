            <p>Our concept was for a non profit, volunteer based sports league called Alley-oop. The organization is based in 
                East Austin to help provide opportunities to kids and families in underserved communities 
                to solve a small portion of the inequality that exists in our society.

            <div class = "problem-b">
                <h3>Problem:</h3>
                <p>Working parents with low incomes want to give their kids opprotunities to play basketball but 
                    struggle to take kids to practice on a consistent basis and struggle to afford league costs. </p>

            <div class = "solution">
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>Alley-Oop keeps total league costs to minimum, offers carpooling options for children who need rides and allows users to sponser
                    families who may need a little extra help when it comes to league funding.

                <p>We targeted Low income families with kids who play sports
                    and focused Alley-Oop's location in East Austin.</p>

        <div class = "user-interviews">
            <h3> User Interviews:</h3>
            <p> Lesley Harris and Carloine Meek conducted 5 user interviews for this project. Our goals as a team
                were to find out what parents in low income families needed most in terms of being able to get their 
                kids enrolled into sports programs. As a team we developed a user interview plan so we were all clear 
                about what was being asked during the interview process.

        <div class = "pain-ponts">
            <h3>Pain Points:</h3>
            <p>Some key pain points for users were that parents found it hard to make time and pay money to travel all over the state
                for different tournaments. Parents also worry about affording league costs in general and wish there was a way to provide
                scholarships for families who want to participate but need extra finacial assistance. 
            </p>

        <div class ="goals">
            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <p>The main goal parents had for their kids was to get them involved into programs so that their kids could get to be active
                and learn from having team experiences.
