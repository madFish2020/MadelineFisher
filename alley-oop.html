            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class = "problem-b">
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Working parents with low incomes want to give their kids opprotunities to play basketball but 
                    struggle to take kids to practice on a consistent basis and struggle to afford league costs. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "solution">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Alley-Oop keeps total league costs to minimum, offers carpooling options for children who need rides and allows users to sponser
                    families who may need a little extra help when it comes to league funding.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'target'>
                <h3>Target</h3>
                <p>We targeted Low income families with kids who play sports
                    and focused Alley-Oop's location in East Austin.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class = 'research-definition'>
            <h2>Research and Definition</h2>
            <p>This was the First step in our teams process. We followed the Design Thinking process throughout. The first thing
                we wanted to do was understand who are user was and what pain points/problems they face trying to sign their kids up for sports.
                We targeted people in a specific demographic since our product was specific to low-income families. After we learned of their struggles
                we had to define not only who are specific user was but what problem we were trying to solve. Two of our teammates conducted research
                and then we all came together to synthesize the data as a team.
            </p>
        <div class = "user-interviews">
            <h3> User Interviews</h3>
            <p> Lesley Harris and Carloine Meek conducted 5 user interviews for this project. Our goals as a team
                were to find out what parents in low income families needed most in terms of being able to get their 
                kids enrolled into sports programs. As a team we developed a user interview plan so we were all clear 
                about what was being asked during the interview process. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "pain-ponts">
            <h3>Pain Points</h3>
            <p>Some key pain points for users were that parents found it hard to make time and pay money to travel all over the state
                for different tournaments. Parents also worry about affording league costs in general and wish there was a way to provide
                scholarships for families who want to participate but need extra finacial assistance. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class ="goals">
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>The main goal parents had for their kids was to get them involved into programs so that their kids could get to be active
                and learn from having team experiences. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class ='affinity-diagram'>
            <img src = 'images/affinity-alley.PNG' alt = 'affinity diagram'>
            <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
            <p>After the reserach was complete we started synthesizing the data with an affinity diagram. We wrote notes from the 
                interviews onto sticky notes and grouped them together to try and find commonalities between the interviewees.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class ='empathy-map'>
            <img src = 'images/empathy-alley.PNG' alt = 'empathy map'>
            <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
            <p>After we found commonalities in our iterviewees we wanted to try and really understand our users on another level.
                We created an empathy map to help guide us to figure out what our users goals and pain points were as well as 
                what they were feeling, thinking and saying about envolving their children in sports leagues.

        <div class = 'user-persona'>
            <img src = 'images/User Persona-alley.png' alt = 'usr persona diagram'>
            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>Once we felt we had a clear understanding of who are users were going to be we created a user persona. Jen is a single mom 
                who has two kids. She struggles managing her work life with her kids extra curicular activities but wants them to be able to
                learn and grow by playing sports.

        </div>
        <div class = 'user-journey'>
            <img class = 'lab-img' src = 'images/01-User Scenario-alley.png' alt = 'user scenario diagram'>
            <h3>User Scenario Diagram</h3>
            <p>We wanted to understand how our users would learn about our app and use it successfully so we jotted down a scenario in which
                Jen would use Alley-Oop to get more information about the basketball league. This diagram outlines her steps to get more information as well as 
                acknowledging her goals, potential risks and emotions during this process.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'user-insight'>
            <h3>User Insight Statement</h3>
            <p>Families with children in underserved communities need accessible sports leagues in their neighborhoods because participating in a sport
               helps kids learn valuable life skills, and income and location are often barriers that take away these opportunities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'value-proposition'>
            <h3>Value Proposition Statement</h3>
            <p>Our organization Alley-oop is developing a non-profit, volunteer based sports league in East Austin to help provide 
               opportunities to kids and families in underserved communities to solve a small portion of the inequality that exists
               in our society.

                We're better because our concept focuses on the real, day-to-day needs of the families in East Austin, and makes sports accessible to all.
                
                We're believable because our organization is a designed specifically to meet the needs of the families and kids we want to serve.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class = 'ideation'>
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>After we defined our user and the problem it was time to think of ways to solve the problem. This led us to the ideate phase of the Design Thinking Process.
            This is wehere we thought of potential solutions and brainstormed as a team. Some of the methods we used were I Like, I wish, What if diagrams, Feature Prioritizations
            and card sorting. 
        </p>
        <div class = 'i-like'>
            <img src = 'images/ilike-alley.PNG' alt = 'i like i wish what if diagram'>
            <h3>I Like, I Wish, What if Diagram</h3>
            <p>To start thinking of potential solutions for our user pain points we did a I Like I Wish What If activity.We chose this method becuase it
                helps start the brainstorming process by thinking of solutions in more ways than one. After we came up with various ideas 
                we each did a round a silent voting putting two dots on the ideas we liked the best.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'feature-prioritization'>
            <img src = 'images/features-alley.PNG' alt = 'feature prioritization matrix'>
            <h3>Feature Prioritization Matrix</h3>
            <p>From our favorite ideas we further organized them into a feature prioritization matrix to determine which ideas would be the best to implement
                in such a short amount of time. We chose from the ideas that were low in complexity but high in impact.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class = 'card-sorting'>
            <img src = 'images/cardsort-alley.PNG' alt = 'Card sorting'>
            <h3>Card Sort</h3>
            <p>Once we knew which features we wanted to include in the site we had to figure out how to organize them. We all organzied the ideas
                together as a team to figure out which layout made the most sense to us.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class = 'competitor-analysis'>
        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>Our main competitor was the YMCA. They have more affordable leagues and have opprotunitites for families in need to recieve financial aid assistnace.
            The only thing about the YMCA is that their locations are spread all over the metropolitan area making it hard to access games in more than one area of town.
        </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class = 'wireframing-prototyping'>
        <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
        <p>In this phase of the Design Thinking Process we started to make our ideas come to life by prototyping. We also tested our ideas
            to see what improvements we could make after we did our low fidelity prototyping.
        </p>
        <div class = 'sketches'>
            <img src = 'images/sketch-alley.PNG' alt ='sketch'>
            <h3>Paper Sketch</h3>
            <p>This was the first layout we had designed. It feataured a hero image with a sign up button that was clearly in view with 
                sessions available right below it. This design continued into our low fidelity prototyping.
            </p>
            <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
            <p>We tried making our own designs for this section of the process because we were not sure how we wanted to lay things out and wanted 
                as many ideas as possible to try and find the best design. Eventually we all came together and designed a set of 5 pages so that we could 
                move forward in the process.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'style-tile'>
            <img class = 'lab-img' src="images/Style Guide-alley.png" alt ='style guide'>
            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>After we decided what layouts we wanted to use for each featured page we decided on styles. Together we came up with the fonts, the images and the 
               signup buttons. Lesley Harris Designed the Logo and I designed the buttons for the pages. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'user-testing'>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>We tested our low fidelity to see what improvements needed to be made to make sure the site was as easy to use as possible. Some things that still needed
                improvement were the hero images. Our users felt as though they did not accurately represent our target kids. People also wanted to be able to access the 
                Sign up link on every page so that they did not have to hunt for the link. Lastly people could not easily access the home page because there was no way to do that
                in the navigation bar. 
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class = 'hifi'>
        <h2>High Fidelity Mockups</h2>
        <p>This was the final step of our design process. We polished everything as much as we could before the deadlines.</p>
        <div class = 'feature-one'>
            <img class = 'alley-img' src = 'images/Home-alley.png' alt = 'home page image'>
            <h3>Home Page</h3>
            <p>Features information about what Alley-Oop is, a way to donate or get involved, provides available sessions for kids and 
                gives parents an easy way to access the sign-up page.
            </p>
            <img class = 'alley-img' src = 'images/About Us-alley.png' alt = 'about us page image'>
            <h3>About Us Page</h3>
            <p>Features information about what Alley-Oop is and what our mission is, provides parents with quotes from parents who have enrolled
                their kids in our league in the past, and gives parents a list of benifits their kids will have as a result of being in the league.
                Sign-up button is on the hero image and is easy to spot.
             </p>
            <img class = 'alley-img' src = 'images/League Info-alley.png' alt = 'league info page image'>
            <h3>League Info Page</h3>
            <p>Features information about equipment costs, locations and what age group we serve. There are also multiple ways to sign up on this page.
               You can acces the sign up on the top or bottom of the page. </p>
            <img class = 'alley-img' src = 'images/Get Involved-alley.png' alt = 'get involved page image'>
            <h3>Get Involved Page</h3>
            <p>Features a sign up button on the hero image, as well as cards for different opprotunities to contribute to Alley-Oop. You can become a volunteer,
                donate or sponser a family in need. The page also has carpooling information so parents can sign up to carpool or sign their kid up to get a ride
                from the parent carpooling that day. </p>
            <img class = 'alley-img' src = 'images/Contact Us-alley.png' alt = 'contact us page image'>
            <h3>Contact Us Page</h3>
            <p>Features a way for users to contact us directly through the site or gives the user the information for reaching us by phone or email if that is preferrable.
               Again you can choose to access sign ups through this page.

            <h3>Mobile Version</h3>
            <p>Make a mobile version of the site! Based on our research, our users access the internet most often from their phones.
               However, they also want access to desktop when they need to find more information.</p>
            <h3>Code and Research</h3>
            <p>We would code website and continue to test and research needs of users if we had more time.</p>
