            <p>Our concept was for a non profit, volunteer based sports league called Alley-oop. The organization is based in 
                East Austin to help provide opportunities to kids and families in underserved communities 
                to solve a small portion of the inequality that exists in our society.

            <div class = "problem-b">
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Working parents with low incomes want to give their kids opprotunities to play basketball but 
                    struggle to take kids to practice on a consistent basis and struggle to afford league costs. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "solution">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Alley-Oop keeps total league costs to minimum, offers carpooling options for children who need rides and allows users to sponser
                    families who may need a little extra help when it comes to league funding.

                <p>We targeted Low income families with kids who play sports
                    and focused Alley-Oop's location in East Austin.</p>

        <div class = "user-interviews">
            <h3> User Interviews</h3>
            <p> Lesley Harris and Carloine Meek conducted 5 user interviews for this project. Our goals as a team
                were to find out what parents in low income families needed most in terms of being able to get their 
                kids enrolled into sports programs. As a team we developed a user interview plan so we were all clear 
                about what was being asked during the interview process. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "pain-ponts">
            <h3>Pain Points</h3>
            <p>Some key pain points for users were that parents found it hard to make time and pay money to travel all over the state
                for different tournaments. Parents also worry about affording league costs in general and wish there was a way to provide
                scholarships for families who want to participate but need extra finacial assistance. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class ="goals">
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>The main goal parents had for their kids was to get them involved into programs so that their kids could get to be active
                and learn from having team experiences.

            <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
            <p>After the reserach was complete we started synthesizing the data with an affinity diagram. We wrote notes from the 
                interviews onto sticky notes and grouped them together to try and find commonalities between the interviewees.

            <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
            <p>After we found commonalities in our iterviewees we wanted to try and really understand our users on another level.
                We created an empathy map to help guide us to figure out what our users goals and pain points were as well as 
                what they were feeling, thinking and saying about envolving their children in sports leagues.

            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>Once we felt we had a clear understanding of who are users were going to be we created a user persona. Jen is a single mom 
                who has two kids. She struggles managing her work life with her kids extra curicular activities but wants them to be able to
                learn and grow by playing sports.

            <h3>User Scenario Diagram</h3>
            <p>We wanted to understand how our users would learn about our app and use it successfully so we jotted down a scenario in which
                Jen would use Alley-Oop to get more information about the basketball league. This diagram outlines her steps to get more information as well as 
                acknowledging her goals, potential risks and emotions during this process.

        <div class = 'user-insight'>
            <h3>User Insight Statement</h3>
            <p>Families with children in underserved communities need accessible sports leagues in their neighborhoods because participating in a sport
               helps kids learn valuable life skills, and income and location are often barriers that take away these opportunities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'value-proposition'>
            <h3>Value Proposition Statement</h3>
            <p>Our organization Alley-oop is developing a non-profit, volunteer based sports league in East Austin to help provide 
               opportunities to kids and families in underserved communities to solve a small portion of the inequality that exists
               in our society.

                We're better because our concept focuses on the real, day-to-day needs of the families in East Austin, and makes sports accessible to all.
                
                We're believable because our organization is a designed specifically to meet the needs of the families and kids we want to serve.</p>
